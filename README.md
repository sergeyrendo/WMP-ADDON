# SuperbWarfare extension mod example

This is an example project of showing how to make an extension mod
for [SuperbWarfare](https://github.com/Mercurows/SuperbWarfare).

This mod added an example vehicle of [Tom F7F](./src/main/java/tech/lq0/extensiontest/entity/Tom7Entity.java), which is
an enhanced version of the original Tom F6F from SuperbWarfare.

To get started, check out [build.gradle](build.gradle) first, add SuperbWarfare as a dependency mod, then just write
your own vehicles or other objects like other normal mods do, make them extend vehicle classes from SuperbWarfare.

TODO: make it possible to directly add custom vehicle containers into SuperbWarfare
